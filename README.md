# RVE-PBC
EPRVEPBCs is a Python code for the computing effective properties of the Representative Volume Element (RVE) under Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBCs)
It can compute the mechanical properties of the composite with periodic structure, in two or three dimensions. The computation is based on a homogenization method.
